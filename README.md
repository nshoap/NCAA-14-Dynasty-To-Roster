# NCAA-14-Dynasty-To-Roster
Converts a NCAA 14 dynasty roster to a normal playable roster

The idea for this began when I had multiple QBs deserving of the starting job and I wanted to have a QB battle, and practice mode in dynasty wasn't cutting it, I wanted to see them in real game situations.  It bothered me that NCAA Dynasty mode did not have a spring game and I decided that I wanted to be able to do a spring game in the play now section of the game, which would require converting my dynasty roster to a normal game roster.
